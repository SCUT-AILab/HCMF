-- over-sold description
Theorem 1 guarantees the correctness of our algorithm.（不是到该说啥了...）

-- technical contributions
Replacing the nuclear norm with a low-rank matrix factorization can not only speed up the fusion process but also be able to handle the large scale problem.
But nuclear norm based methods are limited by the cubic complex, being difficult to deal with large scale problem.

-- too much space for Sec.3.2
...

-- empirical
Our method show a great improvement on UCF-101 and Oxford-IIIT-Pet comparing with LPBoost.
Post-processing steps are detailedly described in Sec.4.4 and carefully choosed via experimental results as Table.3
We use `GATE' strategy for all experiments as mentioned in line 759-760.

-- state-of-the-art
The state-of-the-art fusion methods are already compared in Table.1 and Table.2
Table.5 shows we are able to achieve better performance comparing with the current state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10,100 dataset.

# For Assigned Reviewer 3
How the l1,2 norm helps with outliers are discusses in line-106-111.
Why not l2 norm????...
